# Quantum Unity Framework Blockchain Project

This project aims to develop a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem and a robust development framework. It encompasses various aspects of blockchain development and integration, with several folders within the project linked to other repositories within the same organization.

## Project Objectives

1. **Blockchain Configuration and Deployment**: Configure and deploy a permissioned Hyperledger Besu blockchain to replace the existing Chain ID 138 Defi Oracle Meta mainnet. The new blockchain is divided into three distinct chain IDs: 0x0 (Quantum Unity Framework), 0x9 (Global Digital Currency Network), and 0x8A (Contudo).

2. **Smart Contract Development**: Develop base smart contracts to serve as customizable templates for the AI-powered Asset Token Factory (ATF). Essential libraries and smart contracts are incorporated, including Chain.link, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, and more.

3. **Control Panel and Interactive Builders**: A comprehensive control panel accessible through both text-based and web-based interfaces is created. An innovative system of interactive builders designed for fully conversational interactions is implemented.

4. **Extensive Documentation**: Recognizing the critical importance of documentation in this continuously evolving project, the code is well-commented, with README.md files in every directory. Documentation is produced in multiple formats, including PDF and web-based.

## Project Framework and Standards

Foundational frameworks and standards are established to facilitate easy configuration and one-click deployment. The aim is to create a seamless Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CD/CI) environment using tools like Vercel.

## Development Tools and Environment

"Cursor" is selected as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for the project. Azure is chosen as the initial cloud provider, with plans to expand to a hybrid and multi-cloud environment, including integration with IBM Cloud.

## Additional Requirements

A comprehensive set of scripts to automate various tasks is developed. Documentation is continuously updated and expanded as the project evolves. Missing capabilities and features are proactively addressed, ensuring they are promptly added.
